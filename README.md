# getting started

## Installation

#### Requirements
* PHP
* Apache server
* MySQL Database
* SQL
* phpMyAdmin

> All of these requirements can be completed at once by simply installing a server stack like `Wamp` or `Xampp` etc.

#### Installation Steps
1. Import the `suplike.sql` file in the `inc` folder into phpMyAdmin. There is no need for any change in the .sql file. This will create the database required for the application to function.

2. Edit the `dbh.inc.php` file in the `inc` folder to create the database connection. Change the password and username to the ones being used within current installation of `phpMyAdmin`. There is no need to change anything else.

```php
$servername = "localhost";
$dBUsername = "root";
$dBPassword = ""; 
$dBName = "suplike";  


$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $dBUsername, $dBPassword, $dBName);
```

# inspiration
my biggest inspiration to make this website was was the [KLIK social website](https://) 
whom I also made the readme from and also top social websites like [facebook](https://facebook.com) gave me some tips.
